Emacs is simple and its universe starts from M-x.

* So simple Emacs: Meta Key

Emacs' elegance and simplicity, in a nutshell, is just a Meta key.
Meta key is option or alter key on the keyboard. In etymology, Meta is higher, beyond. Therefore, we could understand Meta as Source, then Meta is associated with Source Code.

In Source Code, function is the first-class citizen. The simple strategy of Emacs is to bind the Meta key (which has source meaning in etymology) to the source-code or function. So we trigger  the button M-x (x for execute) to invoke  the function.

Start form M-x, you can do whatever you desire, such as inserting the current date:

Until now, the design of Emacs in the strategic level have been finished.
The only remaining things are in tactical level about how to implement functions which M-x invoke.

* The primary strategy of Emacs: Introduce the Ctrl key

Take an example  to open a file from a directory, you can M-x find-file,

#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[file:images/00.preface-find-file.png]]

With M-x, we have to type 11 characters to get such a task done.
In contrast, we only type 4 characters as C-x C-f with Ctrl key. As we see, to achieve high efficiency, Emacs's primary strategy is to replace "call function by full name" with the "call function by characters".

A simpler example, such as "move one character forward". The complete implementation is M-x forward-character. But after the introduction of the Ctrl strategy, only the characters of C-f is required.

Since C (Ctrl) simplifies M-x, and the character f is the first letter of the function forward-character.

The above method of calling functions with Control is called Command. Command is equivalent to Contrl, we find that choosing  Ctrl as command is also a semantic binding just as choosing Meta as source-code.
