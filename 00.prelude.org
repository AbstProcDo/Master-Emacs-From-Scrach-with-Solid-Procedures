* Prelude

Emacs is simple and its universe starts from M-x.

* 1.So simple Emacs: Meta Key

Emacs' elegance and simplicity, in a nutshell, is just a Meta key.
Meta is option or alter key on the keyboard. In etymology, Meta means higher, beyond. Therefore, we could understand Meta as Source, and associated it with source-code.

In Source Code, function is the first-class citizen. The simple strategy of Emacs is to bind the Meta key (which has source meaning in etymology) to the source-code or function. Then we could trigger the keys M-x (x for execute) to invoke  the function.

Start form M-x, you can do whatever you desire, such as inserting the current date:

Until now, all the designing works of Emacs in the strategic level have been finished. The only remaining things are in tactical level about how to implement functions which M-x invokes.

* 2.The primary strategy of Emacs: Introduce the Ctrl key

Take an example to open a file from a directory, you can M-x find-file,

#+attr_html: :width 500px

With M-x, we have to type 11 characters to get such a task done.
In contrast, we only type 4 characters as C-x C-f with Ctrl key. As we see, to achieve high efficiency, Emacs's primary strategy is to replace "call function by full name" with the "call function by characters".

A simpler example, such as "move one character forward". The complete implementation is M-x forward-character. But after the introduction of the Ctrl strategy, only the characters of C-f is required.

Since C (Ctrl) simplifies M-x, and the character f is the first letter of the function forward-character.

The above method of calling functions with Control is called Command. Command is equivalent to Contrl, we find that choosing  Ctrl as command is also a semantic binding just as choosing Meta as source-code.
